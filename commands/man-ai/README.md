# üß† man-ai

## Description
`man-ai` enhances the traditional `man` command by finding and suggesting the closest matching command when you mistype or don‚Äôt remember the exact name.  
It helps you quickly open the correct manual page with intelligent search and interactive suggestions.

## Syntax
```bash
man-ai <approx_command_name>
```

## Features of the custom command
- **Fuzzy Command Search:** Uses `compgen` and pattern matching to suggest similar command names.  
- **Interactive Selection:** Prompts the user to pick the right command if multiple matches are found.  
- **Auto Open:** Automatically opens the correct `man` page after selection.
